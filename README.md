DES Encryption and Decryption Tool
This project is a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool for encrypting and decrypting text using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. The tool allows users to enter a plaintext message and a key, encrypt the message, and then decrypt the resulting cipher text.

Features:

Plaintext input: Users can input an 8-character string as plaintext.
Key input: Users provide an 8-character key to encrypt and decrypt the message.
Encryption: The tool encrypts the plaintext using the DES algorithm.
Decryption: The tool decrypts the cipher text back into the original message.
Key visualization: Displays the 16 subkeys used during the DES encryption process in binary format in the console.
Error Handling: Ensures both plaintext and key are exactly 8 characters and provides error messages for invalid inputs or operations.

Prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
Knowledge of how to compile and run Java programs on your system.
